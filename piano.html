piano. is a music term referring to dynamic direction indicating the performer should play softly. However, the group in question is comprised of several sarcastic assholes who have adopted the moniker 'PIANO.' only to play music at a volume the complete opposite of quiet. This rock 'n' roll trio performs loud & devilishly heartbreaking blues. 
PIANO. was formed in 2014, with members: Mike (lead guitar, vocals), Matt (bass, keys, vocals), & Scott (drums, vocals). The trio quickly cemented themselves South Georgia as a power, rock 'n' roll trio, with an energetic live presence. What started as a side project for these experienced musicians, quickly exploded into a full-time band. Since coming together, the band played regularly throughout the Southeast, as well as recorded their first EP, "Tiny Bullet Choir", which was released on February 26, 2015.

'Sick Bones' is PIANO.'s follow up to this past February's release, 'Tiny Bullet Choir EP', & their first full length album. The band returned to Dollhouse Studios in Savannah, Georgia to work with Producer/Engineer Peter Mavrogeorgis (The National, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Creepoid). Sick Bones contains 12 tracks exploring blues, rock & punk music. The album will be available everywhere on Friday, November 13th 2015.

Piano. has been touring the southeast since its inception in September 2014 and have played with acts such as JJ Grey & Mofro, The Mantras, People's Blues of Richmond, Atlas Road Crew, DANK, Funk You & Blackfoot Gypsies. The band will be celebrating their album release with a mini-tour, that​ will take place in November.
