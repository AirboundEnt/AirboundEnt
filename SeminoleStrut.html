Seminole Strut started as a bunch of friends getting together and jamming in late 2012.  These six Huntsville, AL natives had been in various bands growing up, but had never played together as a group prior to the formation of the band. Influenced by a variety of different music styles, they meshed together to forge a unique sound with a modern touch on raw rock and soul music. Backgrounds varying from classic sounds, such as Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, and Derek and the Dominos to the stylings of new sounds like My Morning Jacket, The Snake The Cross The Crown, and various southern soul and rock acts.    After playing together more, they began writing and learning original music until they had enough material to start playing open mic nights around Huntsville. In May 2013, after playing their first full gig in Florence, AL, Seminole Strut traveled to Nashville to start recording songs for an EP at Sound and Audio Engineering (SAE) Institute. Taking three songs away from that session, they recorded and produced three more songs on their own to complete their self-titled six song EP.  By consistently playing shows in North Alabama, they have made a name for themselves as a raw and entertaining live act filled with a big rhythm section powered by three electric guitars. In June 2014 they recorded an album's worth of songs live at King of the Jungle Productions in Birmingham, AL, for their first full length album, Clatter & Howl. These tracks contain a unique and raw sound that captures the band's energetic live sound. Seminole Strut is a hard-working band that is worth coming to see and getting to know.
