Growing up in Richmond Hill, Georgia, music has always been a huge part of Brianâ€™s life.
Playing his first live show when he was only 14, there is nothing that Brian loves more than to be on a stage performing. He believes music is a way for people to escape everyday life and getting lost in a certain melody or lyric is what he loves the most about playing. Brian prides himself on playing music because it is who he is; not for money or attention but because he has been blessed with an ability that not everyone has. He wants to have a good time and give people a way to escape the stress of life.

Brian has had the opportunity to play with amazing musicians such as: Charlie Daniels, Chris Cagle, Jerrod Niemann, Joe Nichols, Jon Langston, among others.
