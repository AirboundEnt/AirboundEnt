The Orange Constant formed in August 2012 and quickly made a name for themselves in Statesboro, GA. Now, The Orange Constant performs in venues all over the Southeast and continues to grow their fan-base with their contemporary yet vintage rock/jam sound. TOC recently recorded their debut album,"Time To Go" with Grammy nominated producer John Keane (REM, Widespread Panic) which was released June 19th. In addition, they have played on bills that include Perpetual Groove, New Orleans Suspects, Atlas Road Crew, and Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band.

The Orange Constant draws influence from many different styles to create a musical experience that is new and unique. Being influenced by bands such as My Morning Jacket, Widespread Panic, and Incubus, TOC focuses their energy on live performances that resonate deeply with the audience. The band consists of Andrew Brantley (guitar/vocal/keyboard), Lee Guentert (drums), Nickalous Benson (guitar/vocal), and Will Goggans (bass/vocal).
