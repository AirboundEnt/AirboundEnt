With the newborn release of their first studio EP, and a sturdy lineup of frequently surfacing material, the Nashville born-and-brought up prog-jammers show no signs of stopping for air. Stockpiling different genres within their compositions, Fraug revels on the idea of instantaneously migrating from one style to the next. With elements of soul, funk, heavy guitar riffs, and improvised jams, they’re prog-jam, as the band refers to it. 

While the band itself is young, the esteem within the group stems from the abiding friendship amongst its members. Between drummer Braxton Pearson and guitarist Dylan Hester, nearly 15 years of musical camaraderie stands between them. Their lifelong friendship and mental union has been used as an instrument for their unyielding pursuit for success. Hester simultaneously shares a lengthy bond with bassist Michael Herrell, who both harnessed their love for playing together during college. The latter addition of keyboardist Michael Jordan proved to be the necessary fulfillment to Fraug’s lineup. 

Over the past year, the amount of time the group has spent playing together has granted them the opportunity to explore their musical stew of influences, and the ongoing interaction on and off stage has grown to allow for continuous songwriting. Fraug has quickly built a character for themselves through the transmission of high-energy performances and steadfast creation of new material. Plans to expand their pack of tried-and-true listeners and continued performances are on the horizon.
