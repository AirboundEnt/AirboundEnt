Universal Sigh is a melodic jazz fusion high energy rock show. The band features a two guitar attack anchored by a driving rhythm section. Universal Sigh’s music reflects a deep fondness for artists such as Radiohead, Snarky Puppy, and Umphrey’s McGee. Influenced by a myriad of musical styles, the quartet has been focusing on crafting a catalog of song varieties ranging from lyrical tunes to instrumental arrangements. Each show is its own individual voyage; harmonious melodies soar through epic peaks and float dramatic descents into a blissful funky groove. Fluid and dynamic, the Sigh is equipped with an abundance of compositions to energize any musical atmosphere.

In the very beginning, with Pace Maynard on guitar and Jones Maynard on drums, the brothers spent most of their childhood playing the White Stripes in their parents basement. Several years later, Jones met songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Steve Terry. The two began making music together during and after high school. Over the next couple months, some sort of strange, raw talent began breeding in that basement. When Pace returned home from a semester at college it was evident a harmonious creation was to unfold. Now in search of a strong bassist, the UGA MBUS program became the missing link the band needed to find Austin Parker - not only a very merry bass player, but dually a soulful vocalist.

The Core Four have been at the forefront of all Universal Sigh songwriting and performance. However, more recently the band has been working to create a collective interest collaborating original pieces with other musicians as much as possible. After a solid two years of songwriting and rehearsal the foursome have gained their fresh tour legs and are ready and able to go anywhere music can be made. Universal Sigh has formed an inseparable bond to music since the very early basement days and are positively eager to extend that friendship with many others on down the road.</br>
