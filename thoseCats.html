Those Cats are a high energy Soul & Funk powerhouse from Statesboro, GA and have been described as "A band whose fresh, funky and soulful sound provides its listeners with a never-ending well of tastefully grooving tracks, perfect for any occasion worthy of music." [Connect Statesboro]. Formed in 2010 by original members Zac Tilson, Scott Underwood, and Miles Wiggins; Those Cats has come a long way since their first EP ‘Less Stress, More Groove.’ Adding vocalist Cyril Durant in 2012, the group has evolved from a 4 piece band into a full fledge, seven person ensemble complete with a horn section and multiple vocalists. Each member draws from their own styles and musical knowledge to create a diverse live music experience filled with original tunes and a few timeless covers. The group has released several live recordings over the past four years, as well as their full length albums, ‘Something More Specific’ & ‘Eyes Up’. Those Cats enjoy collaborating with friends and bands around the Southeast area while aiming to generate a live show that will lift the audience and keep them there!
